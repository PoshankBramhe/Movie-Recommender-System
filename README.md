<b>Movie Recommendation System</b><br>
Overview
Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System project! This project demonstrates the implementation of a content-based movie recommender system using cosine similarity.

Have you ever wondered how Netflix suggests movies to you based on the movies you have already watched? Or how e-commerce websites display options such as "Frequently Bought Together"? Behind these seemingly simple options, complex statistical algorithms execute to predict these recommendations. Such systems are called Recommender Systems, Recommendation Systems, or Recommendation Engines.

A Recommender System is one of the most famous applications of Data Science and Machine Learning. In this project, we explore three types of recommender systems:

Demographic Filtering (Simple Recommender)
Content-Based Filtering
Collaborative Filtering
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the tmdb-5000-movies dataset, a collection of movie information available on The Movie Database (TMDB). It is often used in machine learning and data analysis to explore patterns and trends in the film industry and for building recommendation systems.

Dataset Details
The original dataset was generated from The Movie Database API. This product uses the TMDb API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDb. The data was collected from the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset, a popular movie database website known for its wealth of information on movies, TV shows, and celebrities. The dataset contains two main tables:

movies_metadata.csv
Contains general information about the movies, such as:

id
budget
genres
homepage
keywords
original_language
original_title
overview
popularity
production_companies
production_countries
release_date
revenue
runtime
spoken_languages
status
tagline
title
vote_average
vote_count
Each row corresponds to a movie.

credits.csv
Includes details about the cast and crew of each movie:

cast
crew
Each row corresponds to a crew member (actor, director, writer, etc.) for a specific movie.

Content-Based Filtering
The content-based filtering method used in this project recommends movies based on their features and the similarities between them. Cosine similarity is employed to measure the similarity between movies based on their descriptions.

How to Use
Clone the repository:
sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movies-recommendation-system.git
Navigate to the project directory:
sh
Copy code
cd movies-recommendation-system
Install the required dependencies:
sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the notebook to explore and build the recommender system:
sh
Copy code
jupyter notebook Movie_Recommendation_System.ipynb
Results
The notebook demonstrates how to build and evaluate the three types of recommender systems mentioned above. The content-based filtering system, in particular, uses cosine similarity to recommend movies similar to the ones a user has already watched and liked.
